## Filter on Anchor Point, AK


```{r cars}
Anchor <- snap %>% filter(community=="Anchor Point" & type=="Temperature") %>% select(community, type, daterange, scenario, junMean, julMean,
                                                                                      augMean, sepMean)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
